        <p><h1><center>CSS UNITS</center></h1>
        CSS has several different units for expressing a length.
        Many CSS properties take "length" values, such as width, margin, padding, font-size, etc.
        Length is a number followed by a length unit, such as 10px, 2em, etc.
        A whitespace cannot appear between the number and the unit. However, if the value is 0, the unit can be omitted.

        For some CSS properties, negative lengths are allowed.There are two types of length units: absolute and relative.

<h2><center>Absolute Lengths</center></h2>
        The absolute length units are fixed and a length expressed in any of these will appear as exactly that size.
        Absolute length units are not recommended for use on screen, because screen sizes vary so much. However, 
        they can be used if the output medium is known, such as for print layout.
        <center><table style="border: 2px black solid;">
            <tr style="border: 2px black solid;">
                <td>units</td>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>mm</td>
                <td>millimeters</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>in</td>
                <td>inches (1in = 96px = 2.54cm)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>px *</td>
                <td>pixels (1px = 1/96th of 1in)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>pt</td>
                <td>points (1pt = 1/72 of 1in)</td>

        </table></center>

	
	
	
	
	
<p>	
Pixels (px) are relative to the viewing device. For low-dpi devices, 1px is one device pixel (dot) of the display. 
For printers and high resolution screens 1px implies multiple device pixels.
</p>

<h2>Relative Lengths</h2>
<p> Relative length units specify a length relative to another length property. Relative length units scales better between different 
    rendering mediums.</p>

<h1>Pixels vs. Relative Units in CSS: why it’s still a big deal</h1>
<h2>Long live the modern browser!</h2>

<p>Browsers are getting better these days.
     We seem to be in a golden age where there’s a never-ending stream of new features added for the benefit of the users accessing the page, 
     and really great tools for those creating the page. It hasn’t always been the case, though. </p>
     <p>
     Earlier versions of today’s browsers had limited features, and we had to consider how to work with — or around— those when 
     designing and developing our sites.</p>
     <p>
     Static and adaptive layouts were commonplace, and our sites were designed to pixel perfection.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course there was a distinct amount of pixel pushing gymnastics involved, though, when implementing our layouts 
      within the constraints the browsers provided.
    </p>
    <p>
    As browser features matured, and techniques like Fluid Grids became more commonplace, 
    the way we coded our sites evolved into a whole new paradigm. 
</p>
<p>
    We switched from defining and coding our units of measurement in pixels, and began using relative CSS 
    units and unitless values more consistently in our CSS to meet the needs of ever-changing viewport sizes.
</p>
<p>
    Fast forward to the present, and browser vendors have added in more features to allow us to create flexible 
    and robust designs in a straightforward manner. 
</p>Take for example, browser zooming. When the user zooms the page in 
    a modern browser, everything scales up — or down — proportionally, depending on the user’s preference. Well, at least it should.</p>
<h2>Why is browser zoom a big deal, anyway?</h2>
<p>Allowing the user to control their web browsing experience isn’t a new concept, in fact it’s something that’s been written about
     in the web’s early days. Lately, that concept seems to have been forgotten as the browser features have improved.</p>
<p>
    The most important reason for using responsive and unitless values in our CSS is for supporting our users that rely on zooming. 
    If you read the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, our users need to be able to zoom the viewport without loss of content or 
    functionality, or restrictions imposed by CSS values or viewport scaling settings. In particular, there are a some success criteria 
    to be met:
</p>
    
<p>WCAG 1.4.4: Users must be able to resize text without assistive technology up to 200 percent, without loss of content or functionality. (Level AA)</p>
<p>WCAG 1.4.8: Ideally, we should provide appropriate spacing between lines and paragraphs, and we shouldn’t be requiring the user to scroll horizontally to read a line of text on a full-screen window. (Level AAA)</p>
<p>WCAG 1.4.10: Users must be able to resize text without being forced to scroll both horizontally and vertically to read that content. (Level AA)</p>
