CSS stands for Cascading Styling Sheets, a style sheet language for describing the look and feel of a document written in a markup language like HTML.
Though CSS can be applied to any document that adheres to XML, it is predominantly used for HTML documents.
CSS uses simple English words for various style properties, enabling a very simple syntax.
CSS can be viewed as a list of rules, where each rule consists of one or more selectors (declaration to where the rule should be applied) and what values should be applied.
CSS3 - what's the big deal Unlike the previous versions of the CSS specification, CSS3 has broken down the specification into smaller "modules". Each module either describes the newer capabilities or changes to the previous specification. One key point here is that backwards compatibility is preserved. As a result of breaking down the specification into smaller pieces, each module is in a distinct state of readiness. There are over 50 CSS modules that are in various states of readiness. For the purpose of providing a quick insight, I am listing the modules here.
1. Media Queries - enhancement of @media rules and "media" HTML markup element. 2. Selectors Level 3 - describes the element selectors used in CSS 3. Grid template layout - describes new way to position elements using constraints on their alignment to each other and on their flexibility. 4. Aural Style sheets 5. Backgrounds and borders - describes background colors and images and the style of borders. 6. Basic user interface - describes styling for web pages 7. Basic Box model - describes the layout of block-level content in normal flow. 8. Extended Box model - provides extra control over positioning of floats and the size of boxes. 9. Marquee - describes the marquee effect. 10. Cascading and inheritance - describes how values are assigned to properties. 11. Color - describes color-relates aspects of CSS. 12.

CSSOM View model - describes way to inspect and manipulate the view information of a document. 22. Paged media 23. Positioned layout level 3 - describes ways in CSS to layout parts of a document. 24. Presentation levels - describes ways to step forward/backward through multiple renderings of the same document. 25. Ruby - describes properties to manipulate the positions of "ruby" (small annotations on top of or next to words). 26. Grid Layout - describes how to setup a flexible design grid for an element 27. Regions - describes what can be done with regions 28. Speech - contains properties to specify how a document is rendered by a speech synthesizer. 29. Tables Module - describes the layout of tables. 30. Text - describes the text related properties. 31. Writing Modes - describes the properties that control text direction 32. Line grid - describes text where each symbol in a line is aligned to an invisible grid. 33. Values and units 34. Behavioral extensions to CSS - defines the "binding" property for XBL. 35. Flexible Box layout Level 3 - defines the "flex' and "inner-flex" keywords for the display propert 36. Image values and replaced content - defines how properties can refer to images by URL. 37. Fragmentation Module - describes properties to force or avoid page and column breaks. 38. Transforms - defines 2D and 3D transforms. 39.

Conditional Rules - defines a number of ways to make style rules depend on factors outside the document, such as output media, the capabilities of the user agent, and the URL of the document 44. Device Adaptation 45. Shapes - defines properties to assign a shape to a CSS box, so that the lengths of the lines inside the box are determined by that shape. 46. Compositing and blending 47. Filter effects - defines graphic filters that can be applied to an element before it has been composited. 48. Masking - provides ways to partially or fully hide portions of visual elements. 49.

As we can see, there are a whole lot of modules/profiles for CSS3. In the upcoming articles, we will dig deeper into each of these CSS3 modules. Summary In this article, we learned about CSS3 and the list of modules which comprise CSS3. I hope you have found this information useful.
